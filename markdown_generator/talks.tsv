Improving robustness of large structures segmentation using partial annotations	Talk		"Pavilion 10, Expo Tel Aviv"	8/4/24	"Tel Aviv, Israel"		"We present a new method for partial annotations of MR images that uses a small set of consecutive annotated slices from each scan with an annotation effort equal to few annotated cases. The training is performed by using only annotated blocks, incorporating information about slices outside the structure, and modifying a batch loss function. For fetal body segmentation of in-distribution data, the use of partial annotations resulted in decrease in Standard Deviations of Dice scores by 22% and 27.5% for the FIESTA and TRUFI sequences respectively. For TRUFI out-of-distribution data, the method increased average Dice scores from 0.84 to 0.9."
